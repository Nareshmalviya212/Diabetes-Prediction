# Diabetes-Prediction
* In this case study, we have to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not.
* The dataset we are using is of female, which you can understand by looking at the dataset because it has an input attribute named pregnancy.
* Let's start, the output variable of our dataset is classification, so for this we will train a model on many algorithms of classification. And which model gives the best accuracy they will see
## I trained the model on algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Suppor Vector Machine. In which I got the best accuracy score of 79 in Logistics
